#SUDOKU-CSP

          INTRODUCTION:
In this project, I have implemented backtracking and various constraint
satisfaction algorithms to solve the “Sudoku” game more efficiently.

Added SudokuGameSolver.py which implements all the algorithms in SudokuSolver
class.

Apllied following techniques for Sudoku game:
1. Backtracking
2. Backtracking + MRV heuristic
3. Backtracking + MRV + Forward Checking
4. Backtracking + MRV + Constraint Propagation
